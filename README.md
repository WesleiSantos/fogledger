# FogLedger

FogLedger is tool based on Fogbed. It is framework and toolset integration for rapid prototyping of fog components in virtual-ized environments using a desktop approach for DLTs. Its design meets the postulated requirements of low cost, flexible setup and compatibility with real world technologies. The components are based on Mininet network emulator with Docker container instances as fog virtual nodes.
